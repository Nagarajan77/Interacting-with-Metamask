# Interacting-with-Metamask

In this project, I'm just trying to learn how to interact with metamask using JS. This project I'm not trying to do any kind of interaction with smart contract. It is only limited to understanding, how to connect to Metamask, how to handle events like, user changing his address in Metmask or moving to different network in Metamask.

Make sure we have live sever started else this will not work.

In order to check if a bowser has metamask as an extention, we can use window.ethereum.
